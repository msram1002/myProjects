#PROGRAMMING EXERCISE - Angular JS



**Steps to run the program**
----------------------------

1) Unzip the folder.

2) Select the index_file.html file and open it in your favourite browser. (Sometimes the CDN's do not get loaded due to poor internet connection or any ad-blocker plugin can stop loading of CDN, check for console log for any errors. If any errors found reload the page until the console log is free of any CDN loading errors.)

**Program Functionality**
-------------------------

1) As a teacher, we can enter the name of the student along with his/her test score. We can only enter numerical values in student score field.

2) If any of the field is left blank, upon clicking on 'Add' button, an alert message is displayed to fill up the empty fields.

3) Beside the table, the statistics i.e. min, max and average for the current list of students is displayed and gets automatically updated when there is any addition of new students or on any update/ delete of the existing records.

4) The table supports inline editing of student name and score. Upon edit, click anywhere on the screen to update the fields.

5) A particular student record can be deleted upon clicking on the delete(trash) button. Before deletion, it would ask once again for the confirmation and upon 'Yes' it will delete the record.
